Draw From Hat No Replacement With Constraints. Use case: randomly assigning people to give gifts to while avoiding certain pairings.

## TODO:
1. Add a timestamp to the final results
2. Add a deadline variable and add how many days until that date in the final results (as of the timestamp).
3. Import names from a file (instead of hardcoded)
4. Option to automatically email users (if you want the recipients to be secret, even from the person who runs the script)
